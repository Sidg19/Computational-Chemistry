This is a continuation of the Problem given in the last class
-------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Start with the data containing the coordinates (PROBLEM3.data).

(b) Carry out 10 iterations following the conditions as done before.

Modify and expand the code further to

(c) Calculate the total pairwise potential energy (V) of the system
for all the iterations. Assume that the interaction between
the particles can be described with 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential form.

Report the result for each step and submit the code.


Required data:
-------------
sigma = 3.4 Angs.
epsilon = 1 kJ/mol.
cell dimension (L) = 18.64 Angs.
Cut-off radius(R_c) = 9 Angs.

Hints and important points:
--------------------------
(1) PBC, Minimum Image Conventions and cut-off sphere concept have to be implemented.
(2) V should be reported in kJ/mol unit.
(5) Ignore pairwise interaction for separation less than 3 Angs.
