Write a routine to implement the regular Verlet scheme of integrating
equations of motion. Apply it on the attached data (argon_365.dat) file 
containing the coordinates of 365 Argon atoms in a cubic cell of 
dimension 26 Angs.

Carry out 10 iterations with the time-step (dt) given below. Assume, that
the interactions between the Ar atoms can be described by pairwise 12-6 
Lennard-Jones form, the parameters of which are given below. Report the
coordinates after 5th and 10th iterations and the routine.

Required data:
-------------
sigma = 3.4 Angs.
epsilon = 1 kJ/mol.
cell dimension (L) = 26 Angs.
Cut-off radius(r_c) = 10 Angs.
time step of integration (dt) = 20 fs.
Argon mass = 40 (a.u.)
Proton mass = 1.673 x 10^(-27) kg

Hints and important points:
--------------------------
(1) PBC, minimum image conventions and cut-off scheme have to be implemented.
(2) Force components (F_x, F_y, F_z) should be calculated in kg*Angs/fs^2 unit with
appropriate sign
(3) Assume the initial velocity components (v_x, v_y, v_z) for all the atoms to be zero.
